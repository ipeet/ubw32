 File Description:

 Change History:
  Rev   Date         Description
  1.0   04/30/2008   Initial Release
  					 Adapted from PIC18F87J50 HID Bootloader Firmware
  					 as basis for BootApplication().  The rest of the
  					 code was taken from the Simple HID Demo in 
  					 MCHPFSUSB v2.1.
  1.1				 Modified for UBW32 project with software_key
  					 and different button/LED I/O bits
  1.2				 Fixed bug in boot_software_key_sec so it works 
  					 properly all the time.

	//examples are intended to occupy addresses 0x00-0x7FF or
	//0x00-0xFFF depending on which bootloader is used.  Therefore,
	//the bootloader code remaps these vectors to new locations
	//as indicated below.  This remapping is only necessary if you
	//wish to program the hex file generated from this project with

// packets to your device.  In response to this, all USB devices are supposed to decrease their power
// consumption from the USB Vbus to <2.5mA each.  The USB module detects this condition (which according
// to the USB specifications is 3+ms of no bus activity/SOF packets) and then calls the USBCBSuspend()
// function.  You should modify these callback functions to take appropriate actions for each of these
// conditions.  For example, in the USBCBSuspend(), you may wish to add code that will decrease power
// consumption from Vbus to <2.5mA (such as by clock switching, turning off LEDs, putting the
// microcontroller to sleep, etc.).  Then, in the USBCBWakeFromSuspend() function, you may then wish to
// add code that undoes the power saving things done in the USBCBSuspend() function.

// The USBCBSendResume() function is special, in that the USB stack will not automatically call this

 * Overview:        The USB specifications allow some types of USB
 * 					peripheral devices to wake up a host PC (such
 *					as if it is in a low power suspend to RAM state).
 *					This can be a very useful feature in some
 *					USB applications, such as an Infrared remote
 *					control	receiver.  If a user presses the "power"
 *					button on a remote control, it is nice that the
 *					IR receiver can detect this signalling, and then
 *					send a USB "command" to the PC to wake up.
 *					
 *					The USBCBSendResume() "callback" function is used
 *					to send this special USB signalling which wakes 
 *					up the PC.  This function may be called by
 *					application firmware to wake up the PC.  This
 *					function should only be called when:
 *					
 *					1.  The USB driver used on the host PC supports
 *						the remote wakeup capability.
 *					2.  The USB configuration descriptor indicates
 *						the device is remote wakeup capable in the
 *						bmAttributes field.
 *					3.  The USB host PC is currently sleeping,
 *						and has previously sent your device a SET 
 *						FEATURE setup packet which "armed" the
 *						remote wakeup capability.   
 *
 *					This callback should send a RESUME signal that
 *                  has the period of 1-15ms.

 *                  The modifiable section in this routine should be changed
 *                  to meet the application needs. Current implementation
 *                  temporary blocks other functions from executing for a
 *                  period of 1-13 ms depending on the core frequency.
 *
 *                  According to USB 2.0 specification section 7.1.7.7,
 *                  "The remote wakeup device must hold the resume signaling
 *                  for at lest 1 ms but for no more than 15 ms."
 *                  The idea here is to use a delay counter loop, using a
 *                  common value that would work over a wide range of core
 *                  frequencies.
 *                  That value selected is 1800. See table below:
 *                  ==========================================================
 *                  Core Freq(MHz)      MIP         RESUME Signal Period (ms)
 *                  ==========================================================
 *                      48              12          1.05
 *                       4              1           12.6
 *                  ==========================================================
 *                  * These timing could be incorrect when using code
 *                    optimization or extended instruction mode,
 *                    or when having other interrupts enabled.
 *                    Make sure to verify using the MPLAB SIM's Stopwatch
 *                    and verify the actual signal on an oscilloscope.
